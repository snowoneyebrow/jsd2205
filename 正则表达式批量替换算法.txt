Hi Lin,

%1 in the old format is exactly the same as the wildcard *

The text that * matches is stored in the %1 variable.


%1 in the new format is replaced with this stored text.




For example, the old format:
do%1ad

will match "download" and the %1 variable will contain "wnlo"

with the new format:
__%1__

a new filename is generated:
__wnlo__



Everything will walk through all filenames to try and find patterns.
For example, if all filenames start with foo, then the old format will start
with foo.
If all filenames end with .mp3, then the old format will end with .mp3


So the old format rules are:
%1 will match any number of characters any number of times and store the
matched text in variable %1.
The same applies with variable %2-%9.

The new format rules are:
%1 will be replaced with the matched text from old format.
The same applies with variable %2-%9.

%% = a single literal %
